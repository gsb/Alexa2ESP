# Alexa2ESP
 More than a hundred personalized voice commands per ESP via Alexa voice assistant.

## What is it.
This is a personal project gone public to example a simple way to use the Alexa Voice Assistant, dot or echo, to control an ESP8266 or ESP32. It enables hundreds of voice activated control states for each ESP device, limited only by the maximum allowed Alexa Routines or ESP memory. Alexa to/from ESP communications emulate a dimmable Philips hue Light without its normal on/off switching.

## Code is hacked from Fauxmo library.
Alexa2ESP is poorly hacked version of Xose PÃ©rez's Fauxmo library. The hacks eliminate Alexa's on/off state management to enable the 0 and 100 percent values for use as ESP state values. It ensures that each Aleax voice command is received by a named alexa2esp-device (software) only once; an important feature.

## Examples
